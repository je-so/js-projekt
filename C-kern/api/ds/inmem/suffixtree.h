/* title: Suffix-Tree

   A suffix tree is a tree which stores all suffixes of a given string.
   For "ABABC" all suffixes are: ABABC,BABC,ABC,BC,C and the empty string.
   This implementation considers the empty string as no suffix in contrast to
   the standard definition.

   Time in O(n):
   The construction of a suffix tree runs in time O(n) for
   a given input string of length n.

   If you want to know if a certain substring of length s
   is contained in a suffix tree you can do so in time O(s).

   Reference:
   The algorithm for constructing a suffix tree is from E. Ukkonen (1995).
   See <paper at http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/ukkonen/SuffixT1withFigs.pdf> for
   a thorough description.
