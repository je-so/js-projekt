/* struct: binarystack_t
 * Stores binary data in LIFO order.
 *
 * This implementation tries to avoid any additional memory copy operations.
 * Therefore the caller gets a pointer to the last pushed object as result.
 * This pointer is considered valid as long the object is not popped off the stack.
 *
 * Therefore calling additonal <push_binarystack> and corresponding <pop_binarystack> keeps
 * this pointer valid. Calling <free_binarystack> does invalidate the pointer.
 *
 * Operations:
 * Push - You can push size bytes to the top of stack. This operation only allocates memory
 *        and returns a pointer to it. You need to initialize the content of the
 *        pushed object after it has been pushed.
 * Pop  - Removes size bytes from top of stack.
 *        To access the new top of stack (start address of a previously pushed object)
 *        call <top_binarystack>.
 *
 * Memory Alignment:
 * If you push an object of size X the address of the next pushed object is aligned to size X.
 * So if you need to align memory to number X make sure that every push operation pushes only objects
 * with sizes which are multiples of X. The first pushed object is page aligned (see <pagesize_vm>).
