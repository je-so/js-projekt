/* about:Red black tree
 *
 * See:
 * <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_black_tree> for a description of the algorithm.
 *
 * Properties:
 *    1. Every node is colored red or black.
 *    2. Every leaf is a NIL node, and is colored black.
 *    3. If a node is red, then both its children are black.
 *    4. Every simple path from a node to a descendant leaf contains the same number
 *       of black nodes.
 *    5. The root is always black.
 *
 * Height of tree:
 *    The number of black nodes on a path from root to leaf is known
 *    as the black-height of a tree.
 *
 * 1. The above properties guarantee that any path from the root to a leaf
 *    is no more than twice as long as any other path.
 * 2. A tree of height 2n contains at least N=pow(2,n)-1 nodes =>
 *    A search needs at max 2*log2(N) steps.
 *    The implementation of delete & insert traverses the tree
 *    in worst case twice and therefore needs less than 2*2*log2(N) steps.
 * 3. All operations lie in O(log n).
 *    To see why this is true, consider a tree with a black height of n.
 *    The shortest path from root to leaf is n (B-B-...-B).
 *    The longest path from root to leaf is 2n-1 (B-R-B-...-R-B).
 *    It is not possible to insert more black nodes as this would violate property 4.
 *    Since red nodes must have black children (property 3),
 *    having two red nodes in a row is not allowed.
 *    Cause of property 5 the root has always the color black
 *    and therefore the largest path we can construct consists
 *    of an alternation of red-black nodes with the first node colored black.
 *    For every black node we can insert a read one after it except for the last
 *    one. =>
 *    Length of shortest path of black height n:  = n (property 4)
 *    Length of longest path of black height n:   = n + n - 1 = 2n -1
