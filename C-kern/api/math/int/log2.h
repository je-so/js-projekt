/* function: log2_int
 * Returns the logarithm to base 2 as integer of an integer value.
 * This value is the same as the index of the most significant bit.
 *
 * Special case: In case the parameter value is 0 the function returns 0.
 *
 * The returned value is exact if <ispowerof2_int>(*i*) is true else it is truncated
 * to the next lower int value. The following equation always holds true:
 * > i >= pow(2, log2_int(i))
 *
 * Parameter:
 * i - The argument whose logarithm to base 2 is caclulated and returned. */
