/* title: Exoscheduler
   Runs all registered exothreads in a round-robin fashion.
   A newly created exothread automatically registers itself
   at the corresponding scheduler.
   TODO: The scheduler registers itself with <maincontext_t>.
   TODO: Accessing is possible with a simple call to <exothreadsched_maincontext>.
