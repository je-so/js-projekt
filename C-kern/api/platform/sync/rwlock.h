/* struct: rwlock_t
 * Protect a data structure from access of threads of a single process.
 * Either a single writer is allowed to enter the protected area
 * or one or more readers are allowed to enter.
 * As long as no writer tries to acquire this lock no reader has to wait.
 * If a writer tries to acquire this type of lock it has to wait until
 * all readers have released the lock. A writer inserts itself in waiting list <writers>.
 * If at least a single writer waits all calls to <lockreader_rwlock> inserts the reader
 * into the the <readers> waiting list.
 *
 * The last reader which calls <unlockreader_rwlock> resumes a waiting writer.
 *
 * During this time all other parties (reader or writer) have to wait
 * until all readers and the single writer have released the lock.
 *
 * A call <unlockwriter_rwlock> wakes up first any waiting reader.
 *
 * So a writer releasing the lock wakes up all readers. The last reader releasing the lock
 * wakes up the first waiting writer.
 *
 * Implementation Notes:
 * The implementation an atomic <lockflag>.
 * Every call to <lockreader_rwlock>, <lockwriter_rwlock>, <unlockreader_rwlock> and <unlockwriter_rwlock>
 * acquires this lock. At the end they release the lock.
 *
 * If during operation of <unlockreader_rwlock> or <unlockwriter_rwlock> a writer or reader is woken up
 * the woken up thread acquires <lockflag> and releases it. This ensures that any data written by
 * the caller to <unlockwriter_rwlock> and any data written within the functions <unlockreader_rwlock>
 * or <unlockwriter_rwlock> are known to the woken up thread.
