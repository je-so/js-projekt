/* struct: rwlock_t
 * Protect a data structure.
 * Either a single writer is allowed to enter the protected area
 * or one or more readers are allowed to enter.
 * As long as no writer tries to acquire this lock no reader has to wait.
 * If a writer tries to acquire this type of lock it has to wait until
 * all readers has released the lock (<suspend_thread>).
 * The last reader which calls <unlockreader_rwlock> resumes the waiting writer (<resume_thread>).
 * During this time all other parties (reader or writer) have to wait for <entrylock>
 * until all readers and the single writer have released the lock.
 *
 * Implementation Notes:
 * The implementation uses two mutex_t namely entrylock and exitlock.
 * The entrylock must be acquired by every reader or writer
 * before it is allowed to enter the protected region.
 * If a writer calls <lockwriter_rwlock> it acquires the entrylock and
 * it holds it until it leaves the protected region.
 *
 * It acquires also the exitlock sets <writer> to itself and checks <nrofreader>.
 * It releases <exitlock> and suspends itself if <nrofreader> was != 0.
 * If a reader calls <lockreader_rwlock> it acquires <entrylock> adds 1 to nrofreader
 * and releases it immediately. A reader can only return from <lockreader_rwlock>
 * if <entrylock> is not hold by a writer. This ensures exclusive access to the rwlock.
 *
 * If a reader leaves the protected region it acquires <exitlock>,
 * decreases <nrofreader> and resumes a writer if <nrofreader> == 0.
 * Then it releases <exitlock>.
 *
 * If a writer has been resumed it acquires <exitlock>
 * checks that there is no reader and then it returns from <lockwriter_rwlock>.
 * If there are readers it suspends itself again. This is necessary cause
 * suspend and resume are implemented with signals and it is possible that a
 * resume occurs from a spurious signal received from outside of the process
 * and therefore the writer has to check the condition again. */
