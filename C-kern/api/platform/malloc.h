 * Inits test of system-malloc. The GNU C library offers

 * so it is not necessary to wrap the malloc function
 * with a test implementation.
 * For that reason this function does only two steps:
 * 1. Call system functions which
 *    allocate internal memory (strerror)
 *    which is never freed.
 * 2. Free all allocated but unused memory.
 *    Same as <trimmemory_malloc>. */

 * the layout of all virtual mapped memory pages at the beginning of
 * the test with the layout at the end of the test.
 * If a lot of memory is allocated and freed during the execution
 * of your test it is possible that additional system pages
 * will be mapped into the heap address space.
