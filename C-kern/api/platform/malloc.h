/* function: prepare_malloc
 * Inits test of system-malloc. The GNU C library offers
 * a query function for information about malloced memory
 * so it is not necessary to wrap the malloc function
 * with a test implementation.
 * For that reason this function does only two steps:
 * 1. Call system functions which
 *    allocate internal memory (strerror)
 *    which is never freed.
 * 2. Free all allocated but unused memory.
 *    Same as <trimmemory_malloc>. */

 * It is not necessary to call <trimmemory_malloc>
 * before calling this function.
 * If you do not call <prepare_malloc> before this function
 * then it is called for you if this is necessary.
 * At the start of your test save the number of allocated bytes
 * of system memory returned from <allocatedsize_malloc>.
 * At the end of your test call it a second time
 * and compare the result with the value received from the first call
 * to make sure no system memory is wasted. */

 * This function is useful if you want to compare
 * the layout of all virtual mapped memory pages at the beginning of
 * the test with the layout at the end of the test.
 * If a lot of memory is allocated and freed during the execution
 * of your test it is possible that additional system pages
 * will be mapped into the heap address space.
 * The call to <trimmemory_malloc> unmaps them and
 * makes therefore the layouts comparable. */
