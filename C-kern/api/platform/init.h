/* function: initrun_syscontext
 * Initialize platform and os specific parts of <maincontext_t> and then calls main_thread.
 * If scontext (see <syscontext_t>) could be initialized then main_thread is called
 * and its return value is returned as return value. If an error occurs during
 * initialization only an error code (> 0) is returned, main_thread is not called.
 * If an error occurs during freeing of resources after main_thread has been run, an error
 * code (> 0) is returned.
 *
 * The local store of the main thread (<thread_localstore_t>) is initialized and the
 * contained thread context (see <threadcontext_t>) is initialized to <threadcontext_t.threadcontext_INIT_STATIC>.
 *
 * This function is called during execution of <maincontext_t.initrun_maincontext>
 * to set up the main thread environment which supports the default logging functions.
 *
 * Before calling this function scontext should be set to <syscontext_FREE> else EALREADY is returned.
 * Before this function returns scontext is reset to <syscontext_FREE> to indicate the end of an
 * initialized system context. During execuion of main_thread scontext is initialized to a valid value.
