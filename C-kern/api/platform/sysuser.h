/* title: SystemUser

   Offers interface for accessing current system user
   and authentication of users.

   On Linux the implementation uses PAM so the
   authentication is not restricted to a local password file
   instead it can also be configured to use LDAP.

 * The configuration file for PAM is stored in /etc/pam.d/service_name alternatively in /etc/pam.conf.
 * The fallback to /etc/pam.d/other is made if no service with this name exists. Currently the service name
 * "passwd" (see <sysuser_SYS_SERVICE_NAME>) is used therefore the configuration file /etc/pam.d/passwd
 * is used which is the configuration of the passwd command to change the own password.
