/* title: PageCacheImpl

   Cache for virtual memory pages.

   Virtual memory pages are allocated in big chunks with help of <init_vmpage>.
   This component makes calling into the operating system unnecessary
   every time you need a new page or want to free one.

   It offers pages of size 4096 bytes no matter
   of the page size of the operating system.

   Other page sizes could be supported if necessary.

 * Every <block_t> is divided into sub-blocks of size pagecache_impl_SUBBLOCKSIZE.
 * For every allocation of a page with size pagesize either a new unused sub-block is allocated
 * or one which contains free pages is used.

 *       This helps to place longer living pages on one big block and short living pages on another.
 *       Blocks with pages with short lifetime can be reclaimed faster.
