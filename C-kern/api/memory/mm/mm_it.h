 * Declares an interface function table for accessing a memory manager service.
 * The declared interface is structural compatible with the generic interface <mm_it>.
 * The difference between the newly declared interface and the generic interface
 * is the type of the object. Every interface function takes a pointer to this object type
 * as its first parameter.
 *
 * Parameter:
 * declared_it - The name of the structure which is declared as the interface.
 *               The name should have the suffix "_it".
 * mm_t        - The type of the memory manager object which is the first parameter of all interface functions.
 *
 * See <mm_it> for a list of declared functions.
