/* title: AtomicOps

   Offers atomic operations for type integers.

   Full Memory Barrier:
   The barrier wait until all previous read and write operations are done and it ensures that all future read
   and write operations cannot be moved before the barrier.

   Acquire Memory Barrier:
   All future read and writer operations cannot be moved before the barrier.
   Previous read and write operations may not be done yet.

   Release Memory Barrier:
   Ensures that all all previous read and write operations are done.
   But future read and writer operations could be moved before the barrier.
