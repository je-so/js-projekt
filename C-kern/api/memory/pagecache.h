/* title: MemoryPageCache

   Cache for virtual memory pages.

   Virtual memory pages are allocated in big chunks with help of <init_vmpage>.
   This component makes calling into the operating system unnecessary
   every time you need a new page or want ot free one.

   It offers pages of size 4096 bytes no matter
   of the page size of the operating system.

   Other page sizes could be added supported if necessary.
