/* title: UTF-8
   8-bit U(niversal Character Set) T(ransformation) F(ormat)

   This encoding of the unicode character set is backward-compatible
   with ASCII and avoids problems with endianess.

   Encoding:
   Unicode character       - UTF-8
   (codepoint)             - (encoding)
   0x00 .. 0x7F            - 0b0xxxxxxx
   0x80 .. 0x7FF           - 0b110xxxxx 0b10xxxxxx
   0x800 .. 0xFFFF         - 0b1110xxxx 0b10xxxxxx 0b10xxxxxx
   0x10000 .. 0x1FFFFF     - 0b11110xxx 0b10xxxxxx 0b10xxxxxx 0b10xxxxxx
   0x200000 .. 0x3FFFFFF   - 0b111110xx 0b10xxxxxx 0b10xxxxxx 0b10xxxxxx 0b10xxxxxx
   0x4000000 .. 0x7FFFFFFF - 0b1111110x 0b10xxxxxx 0b10xxxxxx 0b10xxxxxx 0b10xxxxxx 0b10xxxxxx

   The UTF-8 encoding is constricted to max. 4 bytes per character to be compatible with
   UTF-16 (0 .. 0x10FFFF).
