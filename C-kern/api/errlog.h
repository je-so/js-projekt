/* define: LOG_ABORT
 * Logs the name of an aborted of a function as well as the returned error code.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *    err - The error number.
 *
 * Context:
 * If a function encounters an error from which it cannot recover
 * it should roll back the system to its previous state before it was
 * called and use LOG_ABORT(returned_error_code) to signal this fact.
 */

/* define: LOG_OUTOFMEMORY
 * Logs the reason why a function has to abort.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *    size - The number of bytes for which the allocation of memory failed.
 *
 * Context:
 * If a function could not allocate memory of size bytes and therefore aborts
 * whith an error code
 * > LOG_OUTOFMEMORY(size)
 * should be called before <LOG_ABORT> to document the event leading to an abort.
