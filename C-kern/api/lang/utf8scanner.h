 * The protocol of utf8scanner is to call <beginscan_utf8scanner> first and then call
 * one or more times <nextbyte_utf8scanner>, <isnext_utf8scanner>, <peekbyte_utf8scanner>
 * and then <endscan_utf8scanner> if a valid token is recognized.
 *
 * The function pair <beginscan_utf8scanner> and <endscan_utf8scanner> initilaizes the internal token
 * of type <splittoken_t> to the correct values. Use <scannedtoken_utf8scanner> to get a pointer to the
 * initialized token.
 *
 * If <isnext_utf8scanner> returns false during scanning call <readbuffer_utf8scanner> to acquire a new
 * buffer from <filereader_t>. If ENODATA is returned then the whole file is read. */
