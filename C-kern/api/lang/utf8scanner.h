/* title: UTF8-Scanner

   Exports <utf8scanner_t> which supports to break a text file
   into separate strings. The file is read with help of <filereader_t>.
   The common parts of every text scanner is implemented in this type.

/* struct: utf8scanner_t
 * Handles the data buffers returned from <filereader_t> and initializes a token of type <splitstring_t>.
 *
 * Protocol:
 * The token begins with the first read byte or character and can span two buffers.
 * Call <nextbyte_utf8scanner> and <nextchar_utf8scanner> to read the buffer content
 * until you have found a valid token. Call <unread_utf8scanner> if you want to remove one or
 * more of the last characters added to the token. A call to <scannedtoken_utf8scanner> returns
 * the scanned token. If the token is processed call <cleartoken_utf8scanner> to clear the token
 * and free any unsed buffers. Clearing a token sets the starting point of the new token.
 *
 * Use <filereader_t> which is given as parameter to determine if a read error has occurred.
 *
 * If the buffer is empty use <readbuffer_utf8scanner> to read the next buffer of the input data.
 * The function <nextchar_utf8scanner> calls <readbuffer_utf8scanner> automatically if the buffer is empty.
