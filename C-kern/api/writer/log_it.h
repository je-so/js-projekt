/* title: Log-Interface
   Interface to access log service.
   An interface is a structure which lists function pointers.
   These function pointers point to functions exported by a service implementation.
   Used in <LogWriter>.

 * Use this macro to define an interface which is structural compatible

 * The difference between the newly declared interface and the generic interface
 * is the type of the object. Every interface function takes a pointer to this object type
 * as its first parameter.
 *
 * Parameter:
 * declared_it - The name of the structure which is declared as the functional log interface.
 *               The name should have the suffix "_it".
 * object_t    - The type of the log object which is the first parameter of all log functions.
 *
 * List of declared functions:
 * printf       - See <logwriter_t.printf_logwriter>
 * flushbuffer  - See <logwriter_t.flushbuffer_logwriter>
 * clearbuffer  - See <logwriter_t.clearbuffer_logwriter>
 * getbuffer    - See <logwriter_t.getbuffer_logwriter>
