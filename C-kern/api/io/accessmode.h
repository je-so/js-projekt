/* enums: accessmode_e
 * Determines how you can access a data block (on disk or in memory).
 * You can view it either as a right what you can do with it
 * or as some kind of protection what you can not do with it if
 * you have not set the corresponding mode bit.
 *
 * accessmode_NONE      - Neither read nor write nor exec is allowed.
 * accessmode_READ      - Allows for reading (only).
 * accessmode_WRITE     - Allows for writing (only).
 * accessmode_EXEC      - Allows for executing (only). This is normally supported only in combination with <accessmode_READ>.
 * accessmode_RDWR      - Combination of <accessmode_READ> and <accessmode_WRITE>.
 * accessmode_RDEX      - Combination of <accessmode_READ> and <accessmode_EXEC>.
 * accessmode_PRIVATE   - Write access to data or memory block is private to its process (COPY_ON_WRITE).
 *                        This must be ored together with another value. It is not useful of its own.
 *                        This value is default for allocated memory or mapped (virtual) memory even if you do not
 *                        request it explicitly.
 * accessmode_SHARED    - A write to a data or memory block is shared between all processes.
 *                        This mode needs some external synchronisation mechanism to prevent race conditions.
 *                        This must be ored together with another value. It is not useful of its own.
 *                        This value is default for accessing persistent data blocks on files or other devices
 *                        even if you do not request it explicitly.
 *                        Most devices do not support <accessmode_PRIVATE>.
 * accessmode_RDWR_SHARED     - Combination of <accessmode_RDWR> and <accessmode_SHARED>.
 * accessmode_NEXTFREE_BITPOS - Next free bit position useful in a subtype of <accessmode_e>.
