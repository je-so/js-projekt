/* title: File

   Offers an interface to handle system files.
   A file is described as system specific file descriptor <sys_iochannel_t>
   which is renamed into <file_t>.

   A file descriptor is an id that identifies an input/output channel
   like files, network connections or other system specific devices.
   Therefore I/O operations on <file_t> can be used also on other I/O objects.

   Includes:
   You need to include "C-kern/api/io/accessmode.h" (<IO-Accessmode>)
   and "C-kern/api/io/iochannel.h" (<IOChannel>) before htis file.
