/* title: File

   Offers an interface to handle system files.
   A file is described as system specific filedescriptor <sys_filedescr_t>
   which is renamed into <file_t>.

   A filedescriptor is an id that identifies an input/output channel
   like files, network connections or other system specific devices.
   Therefore I/O operations on <file_t> can be used also on other I/O objects.
