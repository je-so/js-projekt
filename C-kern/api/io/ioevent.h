/* enums: ioevent_e
 * Defines list of IO events. Every events is represented a single bit value
 * and therefore a set of events can be stored as bit vector in an integer of at least 8 bit.
 *
 * ioevent_READ   - You can read from file descriptor.
 *                  It is possible that this bit is set but reading returns 0 bytes read.
 *                  This can happen on a connected network socket.
 *                  In this case the peer has shutdown the connection for writing or the own side
 *                  has shutdown the connection for reading. In both cases you should
 *                  no longer wait for events of type ioevent_READ. In case of <iopoll_t> you
 *                  should call <updatefd_iopoll>.
 * ioevent_WRITE  - You can write to a file descriptor. This bit can also be set even if you can not write
 *                  cause of an error. So check first the <ioevent_ERROR> condition.
 * ioevent_ERROR  - An error condition is signaled on file descriptor.
 *                  This signals that a network error occurred or that you can no longer write
 *                  to a pipe cause the reading side has closed the connection.
 * ioevent_CLOSE  - The peer of a stream oriented connection (pipe, TCP/IP, ...)
 *                  has closed the connection. If <ioevent_READ> is also set you should
 *                  read the data before closing your side of the connection.
