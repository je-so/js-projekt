/* title: Log-Object

   Interface to access log service. An interface is a structure which lists function pointers.
   These function pointers point to functions exported by a service implementation.
   Used in <LogWriter> and <LogMain>.

 *
 * log_flags_NONE      - Indicates that the log entry does not change append or not append state.
 *                       If the last call to print contained <log_flags_START> the new entry is appended.
 *                       If the last call to print contained <log_flags_END> the new entry is not appended.
 * log_flags_START     - Indicates that this is the beginning of a new log entry.
 *                       This flag implicitly ends the previous log entry if not done explicitly.
 *                       The log entry is therefore not appended to a previous one.
 *                       Every following log output is now appended to a memory buffer and truncated if necessary
 *                       until another call to print is done with flag set to <log_flags_END> or <log_flags_START>.
 * log_flags_END       - Indicates that this is the last part of a log entry.
 *                       You can set <log_flags_START> and <log_flags_END> at the same time to indicate
 *                       that the printed log entry should not be appended to a previous one and the following
 *                       entries should not be appended to this one.
 * log_flags_OPTIONALHEADER - A given <log_header_t> is only written before the log entry if the pointer to the function name
 *                            in <log_header_t> differs from the pointer given in the previous call.
 *                            The flag <log_flags_END> sets the remembered pointer to the function name to 0.
 *                            Set this flag on the last part of the log entry if another header could be written in the same function
 *                            with flag <log_flags_START>.
 *                            Both log macros <TRACEABORT_ERRLOG> and <TRACEABORTFREE_ERRLOG> set this flag. They do not know
