 *                       This channel is written to STDERR if not configured otherwise.
 * log_channel_WARN    - Uses warning channel for log output.
 *                       The warning channel is used to warn of non critical conditions.
 *                       This channel is written to STDERR if not configured otherwise.
 * log_channel_ERR     - Uses error channel for log output.
 *                       The error channel is used to log system error which should not occur
 *                       and which are not critical to the running process.
 *                       This channel is written to STDERR if not configured otherwise.
