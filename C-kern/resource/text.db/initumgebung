# TEXT.DB (1.0)
# documentation:
# List of modules with initumgebung_ / freeumgebung_ functions called once per thread.
# Init functions are called from first to last entry in this database.
# Free functions are called from last entry to first entry.
# The header-name field references the C99 header file which exports the function prototypes.
# Value "shared" in column »type« indicates that parameter is located in umgebung_shared_t instead
# of umgebung_t. The services in umgebung_shared_t are shared by all threads. Every umgebung_t object
# points to the same umgebung_shared_t object. Shared init/free calls are called therefore only once.
