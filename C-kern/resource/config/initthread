# TEXT.DB (1.0)
# documentation:
# List of modules with initthread_ / freethread_ functions called once per thread.
# They are called from init_threadcontext and free_threadcontext.
# Init functions are called from first to last entry in this database.
# Free functions are called from last entry to first entry.
# The header-name field references the C99 header file which exports the function prototypes.
# The field inittype determines what kind of init function is called.
# Possible values:
# "initthread" - Calls initthread_module(parameter) / freethread_module(parameter)
# "interface"  - Calls init_module(&threadcontext_t->parameter) and free_module
#                and sets threadcontext_t->parameter.iimpl == interface_module().
#                Parameter is considered of type iobj_t which allows to call functions with an interface.
#                The memory is allocated and freed with ALLOCSTATIC_PAGECACHE / FREESTATIC_PAGECACHE.
# "object"     - Calls init_module(&threadcontext_t->parameter) and free_module
#                Parameter is considered a pointer of to a object type (struct) where functions directly (no interface).
#                The memory is allocated and freed with ALLOCSTATIC_PAGECACHE / FREESTATIC_PAGECACHE.
# "allocmemory" - Must be listed once before any other of type object or interface.
#                 The allocation and freeing of static memory is done only once.
