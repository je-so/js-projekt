Goal:
  To develop a database with its own transactional programming language.
  Implementation language is C99. Currently different sub-projects
  integrated as one C-kern(el) are used to build up the
  whole system step by step.
 
Subprojects (codenamed):
  [ !! only Genmake is currently published !! ]
  ------------
  : C-Skript :
  ------------
  (Goal: to automate writing recurring code patterns)
  Simple macro language which allows to generate C-Code.
  -----------
  : Genmake :
  -----------
  (Goal: to automate builds)
  Simple project description which generates makefile for project.
  --------
  : Thor :
  --------
  (Goal: to simplify handling of complex data structures)
  To develop a transactional hierarchical object database
  suitable to store context information gathered during parsing.
  --------

State:
  Architecture - design phase.
  Linux-only support during development.
  Some documentation is only in German during development.

Build:
  Run 'make' in the top level directory.
  This should build all subprojects.

  The main makefile ('Makefile') calls for every subproject the corresponding 
  makefile in 'projekte/makefiles/'.

Documentation:
  The documentation is extracted from the source files by naturaldoc.
  Type 'make html' to run it. Make sure you have installed v1.5 on your system.
  Type 'firefox html/index.html' to view it (replace firefox with your favourite browser).
