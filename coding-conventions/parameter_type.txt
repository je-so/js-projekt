title: parameter types

Desctribes the different parameter types of functions.

group: Different Types

There exist four kind of parameter types.
Function parameters are distinguished according to their direction of information flow.

/*in*/    - Input parameter. The value is read by the called function but not changed.
            If it accepts only a pointer to the value the parameter should be marked with
            *const* (const type_t * value). To flag it with the label /*in*/ is redundant.
/*inout*/ - This kind of parameter is read from as well as written to.
            Preallocated return parameters like queried names fall in this category.
            Marking it with label /*inout*/ is redundant, cause every pointer to a non-const
            value is considered to be inout, provided that is not assigned a label indicating otherwise.
            The returned value is only valid, if the function returns success.
            *07 Aug 2012*new* In case of an error the value should be cleared.
            This has two advantages. The first is that return values which must be constructed
            in several steps can use the return parameter as buffer and in case of error clear
            it. The second advantage is that in case no error checking is made the returned value
            is definitely in a defined cleared or empty state.
/*out*/   - The parameter is only written to. It carries the result value of a function and
            is only valid if the function returns success. In case of a complex init function which can
            carry out its operation only on the original out parameter it is allowed to operate on the out
            parameter directly. In case the complex operation fails at some point in time the init function
            must ensure that the out parameter is reset to a FREEABLE (free be can called without error) state.
            *07 Aug 2012*new* In case of an error the value should be set to a cleared / FREEABLE state.
            This has two advantages. The first is that return values which must be constructed
            in several steps can use the return parameter as buffer and in case of error call free.
            The second advantage is that in case no error checking is made the returned value
            is definitely in a defined freed state.
/*ret*/   - The parameter contains the result or return value in case of success.
            In case of error it is either left unchanged or reset or cleared.
            The parameter must be initialized by the caller of the function before the function is called.
            It must be freed by the caller after the return value is no more required.
            The type <wbuffer_t> is used typically as a parameter of such a type.
            It can store return values of unknown size.
/*err*/   - This parameter is only written to and conveys an extended error description.
            The returned value is only valid if the function returns an error.
            In case of success this value is never changed.

about: Function initializing an object

> extern int init_slist( /*out*/slist_t * list ) ;
> int err ;
> slist_t list ;
> err = init_slist( &list ) ;
> if (err) { printf("error\n") ; }

about: Extended Error Description

> int new_regexpression(
>    /*out*/regexpression_t    ** regex,
>    /*err*/regexpression_err_t * syntax_err,
>           const char          * definition ) ;
> int err ;
> regexpression_err_t syntax_err ;
> regexpression_t   * regex = 0 ;
> err = new_regexpression( &regex, &syntax_err, ".*:[0-9]*: .*") ;
> if (err) { /* check syntax_err for extended error information about syntax error */ ... }
