title: Context-Oriented-Programming
The idea behind COP is that a function is aware of its execution context.

OOP has the concept of a method which is a function being aware
of its object context. COP goes a step further in that functions are
also aware of the thread, process and general service context like
the current transaction.

The execution context of a function (system, process, thread, call stack, object, ...)
is handled implicit by a compiler and the operating system.
To make these things more amenable a programming should make them explicit.
The current transaction context as an example for a service is made
available in the context-object (maincontext_t).
