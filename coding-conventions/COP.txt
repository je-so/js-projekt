title: Context-Oriented-Programming

Idea:
The idea behind COP is that a function is aware of its execution context.
The execution context of a function (system, process, thread, call stack, object, ...) is handled implicit by a compiler and the operating system.

To make these things more amenable a programming environment should make them explicit. The current transaction context is an example for a service that is made available in the context-object (maincontext_t).

Compare with OOP:
OOP has the concept of a method which is a function being aware
of its object context. COP goes a step further in that functions are
also aware of the thread, process and general services like
the current transaction.
