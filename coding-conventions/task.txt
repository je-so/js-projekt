   * system processes
   * system threads

   Synchronous, cooperative multi-threads running quasi-parallel.

   Also called stackless threads, protothreads or coroutines.

   *exothread* - A thread which stores its execution context and state
                 in an external object.

about: System process

   Do not use them. There will be a higher level abstraction
   which maps either to a thread or a process.
