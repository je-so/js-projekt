title: Taskmanagement

   The current implementation supports

   * exothreads
   * ??? (higher level abstraction)
   * system processes
   * system threads

about: Exothread
   Synchronous, cooperative thread running quasi-parallel.

   Also called stackless threads, protothreads or coroutines.

   *exo*       - A prefix meaning outside or external (Greek origin).
   *exothread* - A thread which stores its execution context and state
                 in an external object.

   It is possible to call them exthreads or xthreads for short.

   Exothreads are grouped together and every such group is
   executed by exactly one thread.

   At any time only one xthread is executed from one group.
   The programming style is synchronous. Explicitly giving
   up the processor gives other exothreads in the same group
   a chance to run. Locks and other synchronisation mechanisms
   are not necessary.

about: System process

   Do not use them. There will be a higher level abstraction
   which maps either to a thread or a process.
