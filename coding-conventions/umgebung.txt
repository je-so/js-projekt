title: Umgebung (oriented programming)

»Umgebung« is the German word for environment.

The Umgebung is an object of type <umgebung_t>.
It defines a reference to every offered service
a running thread wants to use.

Every thread has its own <umgebung_t> object
so most services can be implemented without
locking mechanisms or other means to make them
thread safe.

Only basic services which are used for interthread
or interprocess communications must be programmed
in a thread safe way.
